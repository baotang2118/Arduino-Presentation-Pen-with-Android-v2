# Arduino-Presentation-Pen-with-Android-v2

Hi! The presentation pen on online marketplaces are so expensive. Did you think you can have a cheaper one? Today I will show you how to make a cheap wireless presenter using your own smartphone and an Arduino. My presentation pointer doesn’t use wi-fi nor require installing any app on you host pc, so it’s easy to move and no latency.

Take a look at my post, Thank you.

Just download and open project by android studio, build it and load it into your phone. Do the same for arduino code.
